				<hr class="border-hr mb_20">
				<div class="Roboto size_16 normal mb_20">Short term binary options are contracts that expire in less than an hour. The most commonly available short term binary options contracts are from as little as 30 seconds to 15 minutes. </div>
				<div class="Roboto size_16 normal mb_20">Short term binary options contracts are popular with traders due to the fact that they are not only exciting to trade but also give good returns in a short span of time, if traded correctly. Short term binary options are mostly suited for the CALL/PUT or Above/Below type of binary options contracts which are commonly traded. However, despite the action and the excitement that comes with trading short term binary options, the fact is that such type of binary options can often end up resulting in a trade taking losses if not trading correctly.</div>
				<h2 class="Roboto size_21 bold mb_20">How to trade short term binary options?</h2>
				<div class="Roboto size_16 normal mb_20">The most ideal times to trade short term binary options contracts is when there is a strong move in the market. Such type of moves typically comes around a major news release or during the opening session of the markets, such as the European or London opening session and the US trading session. Prices tend to make strong short term moves in the markets which usually lasts for around 5 minutes or less during the opening hour of a major trading hub.</div>
				<div class="Roboto size_16 normal mb_20">For the average trader, it is best to trade the short term binary options contracts around these times. The London trading session starts at 0700 hours UK time. Traders can purchase their CALL or PUT options around these times in order to make a quick profit in the markets.
The first chart below shows an example of the GBPUSD price move during the first hour of the London trading session open, on the 5 minute chart.</div>

				<div class="Roboto size_16 normal mb_20">Besides trading the opening session, short term binary options are also ideal to trade during important news releases such as GDP report, unemployment reports and so on, as long as the economic report in question has a simple binary outcome without too many variables in play. Traders can simply wait for the news release and can purchase CALL Options after the first 5 minutes of the news release with a 30 second or 60 second expiry time. Likewise, PUT Options can be purchased on the appropriate currency pairs.</div>
				<div class="Roboto size_16 normal mb_20">Short term binary options as shown above can be a great way to make quick profits in a very short span of time. However, traders should always apply caution when trading such short time frames as picking the wrong asset or instrument or selecting a wrong time to trade could result in the binary options contract expiring out of the money. </div>
